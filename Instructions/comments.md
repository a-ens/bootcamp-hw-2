Congratulations on a great homework assignment! You were able to demonstrate your ability to create a beautiful portfolio page! On the same note, great job implementing flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables! You were able to use the acceptance criteria as a guide and help you navigate the esthetics of your portfolio. It seems that the first portfolio image is not larger than the rest, the projects do not have a deployed link when clicking on them, and there are no titled images similar to how the mock-up was shown. In the README there is no link to the deployed portfolio and no image of the portfolio. Media queries were not set up properly as well, the page is sort of out of wack when smaller screen size is presented. Lastly, there was a lack of commits, make sure to actively commit your code while working. Other than this, good job and nice start to your coding career! CG Conner
